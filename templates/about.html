        A book discussion club is a group of people who meet to discuss a book or books that they have read and express
        their opinions, likes, dislikes, etc. It is more often called simply a book club, a term that is also used to
        describe a book sales club, which can cause confusion. Other frequently used terms to describe a book discussion
        club include reading group, book group, and book discussion group. Book discussion clubs may meet in private
        homes, libraries, bookstores, online forums, pubs, and in caf√©s or restaurants over meals or drinks.

        A practice also associated with book discussion, common reading program or common read, involves institutions
        encouraging their members to discuss select books in group settings; common reading programs are largely
        associated with educational institutions encouraging their students to hold book discussion meetings.
